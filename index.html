					<h4 class="section-subheader text-center">How We Met: As told by Brenda</h4>
					Ryan and I were set up on a blind date by two of our good friends, Natalie and Vito, in February of 2014. We had agreed that I would meet them at Vito's house and the four of us would go out on a double date for dinner and drinks. I really wasn't interested in dating during that time in my life and was trying to find any excuse not to go. (I mean, who really enjoys blind dates?) Natalie knew there was a good chance I would cancel, so she showed up to my work that day to make sure I wouldn't flake. I remember driving over to Vito's after work wanting to get the night over with. We were awkwardly introduced and kind of got off to a bad start because I was annoyed that Ryan didn't open the car door for me (he apparently was very nervous). The first hour was followed by small talk during drinks at BJ's and I felt like he was ignoring me. I excused myself to go to the bathroom and Natalie followed to ask me what I thought about Ryan. I told her I thought he was attractive but he didn't seem interested. Of course, our little matchmaker Natalie made sure to pull Ryan aside that evening to give him a pep talk because he mutually thought the same thing. After getting the inside scoop-and these are Ryan's words, not mine-it was "game over" for him. We exchanged numbers and went on a hike the next day and we went on our first real date a week later. Ryan took me to his favorite childhood restaurant, Miceli's, in Studio City, followed by drinks and dancing at The Sayers Club in Hollywood. A few months later, Ryan officially asked me to be his girlfriend. I knew very early on that Ryan was special and that I had found the man I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

				<p>
					The idea of me proposing to Brenda happened while I was playing basketball. I was shooting around thinking of how much I love her and how I couldn't picture my life without her. I had many thoughts go through my head on how I wanted to propose to her. I wanted it to be a special moment that Brenda and I would never forget. I originally planned to propose to her at Towsley Canyon which was the first place we spent time alone together when we went on a hike the day after we were introduced. I reached out to Brenda's good friend Rachel to get her input. She expressed so much emotion and excitement for Brenda and I and came up with the perfect idea of using her birthday as a distraction. They would have a girls' day and sleepover, then go on a hike to Towsley next morning. However, mother nature got in the way of my plan. There was a huge fire the weekend of the proposal and Towsley Canyon was closed. I thought this was a sign to postpone everything, but Nancy, Michelle, and Rachel were reassuring. Nancy came up with the idea to go check out a couple more hiking sites in Malibu, and Point Dume was perfect. I found a viewing platform that looked over the ocean where I could hide and surprise Brenda. 
				</p>
				<p>
					On July 24th, Nancy, Michelle and I woke up early to meet Patrick at Point Dume. We all arrived at the location around 8 a.m. to prepare. Rachel texted me that she was arriving with Brenda and the rest of her friends and all of us went to our hiding spots. However, unexpected guests kept coming over to the viewing point to take pictures and I even had one person come up and ask me what I was doing under the platform. As soon as I saw the platform empty of strangers, I started playing our song (Thinking Out Loud by Ed Sheeran) and the girls walked away and left Brenda alone. Brenda was confused and when she saw me under the platform she originally thought I was a bum. When she realized it was me she knew what was going on. I then got down on my left knee and asked her to marry me. That day was the best day of my life because I knew that I was going to spend the rest of my life with my best friend.

							<p class="brides-grooms-text pt-2">
							I'm honored to have my sister Nancy be my maid of honor. Nancy has been working in Spain as an English teacher for the past year and graduated from CSU Long Beach in 2016 with a BA in History. She is intelligent, independent, and pretty feisty (she gets it from my dad's side). It's been hard not seeing her for almost a year but I'm happy she's enjoying seeing the world while she's still young. Thankfully, she'll be home during the summer to help out with the rest of the wedding planning and whip everyone in our wedding party into shape with that feisty attitude of hers. </p>

							Michelle is the youngest of us Estrada girls and has lived with Ryan and I for the last two years. She's the baby of the family and I'm very overprotective of her, but I do it out of love. Michelle is a free spirit who gets along with everyone and has an infectious laugh. She immediately makes friends with anyone she meets and has a great sense of humor--I love that about her. She hopes to get her Bachelor's degree in American Sign Language/Deaf Studies and I know that she'll do great things and touch many lives along the way.</p>

							Rachel is one of my best friends and we have quite a funny story. We immediately became best buds in the 3rd grade because we were the top two students in our class. One of my fondest memories of Rachel is when she came to my 11th birthday party and gave me an illustrated children's bible (probably the only bible I've read, ha). After 3rd grade, Rachel moved away, but little did I know that our paths would cross again in high school. We rekindled our friendship in 11th grade and it was like old times. Through thick and thin, Rachel has always been there for me--moving, breakups, and new beginnings. She is so funny, intelligent, and thoughtful, and an incredible friend.</p>

							Deidre is also one of my best friends and I met her through Rachel my junior year of high school. We quickly became really good friends and were in a couple of classes together our senior year. I'll never forget our hilarious video project we worked on together in our 12th grade Mythology course. After we graduated high school, Deidre moved up to San Francisco for college, but we would always hang out when she came back home during the summer and throughout the years our friendship has never wavered. Deidre is so caring, has the biggest heart, and is a very sentimental person. I really admire her as a person and her character and compassion continually inspire me. </p>

We remained friends through high school and community college. We'd spend countless hours studying together for Microbiology and Anatomy & Physiology and I always remember Natalie would get me through long hours in the library with all the snacks she'd pack for the day. Natalie followed her dream of becoming an RN and now lives in Las Vegas with her fiance, Vito, but always texts me to keep in touch--and it's rare to have friends like that nowadays. I will always be grateful to her and Vito for introducing me to Ryan. </p>

We've been through it all together: running around in our pajamas, the crazy fights we had as kids, him destroying my Kobe Basketball cards after beating him in basketball to name a few. I have so many memories I could share but I could never put into words how much he means to me. I would do anything for my brother. He has been my one constant my entire life. We are very different but yet so much alike. Regardless how annoying he can be I could not picture my life without him.</p>

I would spend a week every summer at my Aunt Kate's and Uncle Ron's house and always looked forward to doing fun things with Jacob like playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and going to the Wave Waterpark. One thing about Jake is he never stops thinking.  He has always been an entrepreneur from raising pigs to starting his own company in Colombia.  I look up to him in many ways but the one that sticks out to me is the way he treats people.  Jake is the most respectful person I know, is a great husband, and is always encouraging people to do good things and be the best they can be.</p>

From day one Vito treated me like a younger brother. He would pick on me and tease me but more importantly he took me under his wing and always had my back. Vito and our friend Alex are responsible for my legendary nickname Pooty. To this day the name has stuck.  When he calls me by my first name it just doesn't sound right. Even after high school and to this day he treats me the same way. The name is Pooty spin it backwards Ytoop.</p>

He came off kind of dorky and had a lot of energy. After getting to know Matt, I learned that we had a lot in common such as music, sports, and end up in funny situations together. He became someone I could always depend on and was always supportive of my decisions.  We have had our up and downs but no matter what we have always respected each other and have been there for each other when it counts.</p>

Even though we knew each other from school, we didn't become good friends until we worked together at Sears in Valencia. The things he would pull there would drive me nuts. What really brought our friendship together was GGGGG G-Unit. Every time a member of G-Unit released an album we would always go to Best Buy, then go to his house to listen to the entire thing. The things I cherish about our friendship are his loyalty and his willingness to drop everything to help you out. </p>
